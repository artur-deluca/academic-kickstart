<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the <a href="https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en">University of Rome</a>. But I am currently pursuing research programs involving the problems of Statistical Learning and optimization within (but not restricted to) Deep Learning.
<br><br>

Please feel free to reach me within any of the digital medium available here. I currently live in Rome but I'm originally from Brazil. My favorite activities are listening to unfamiliar genres of music and running, although usually not at the same time :smiley:.
